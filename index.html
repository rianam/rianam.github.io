        <p> My name is Riana Marisol Melendez. I am 19 years old and currently a transfer junior journalism major at the University of Florida. 

<p>Beginning with my trip to Italy at 17 and followed by a trip to Ireland at 18, inspired by four teenagers ready to prove that we were old enough to venture the world without adults, I fell in love with traveling. Now at 19 I am planning a trip with more friends to explore Iceland and Spain this summer. </p>

<p>Although both of my parents were born in Puerto Rico, I had the pleasure of being born in ice cold Grand Rapids, Michigan. At age 11 my mother decided that she wanted a fresh new start somewhere new, and took her real estate business and moved it to Avon Park, FL, where I have lived ever since. </p>

<p>Although figuring out what I wanted to do with my future was a very tough decision for me, I decided to pursue journalism half way through getting my associates in arts.</p>
            
<p>I am absolutely in love with books. From a very young age I just loved opening a good book and getting drawn in and lost in the words for hours at a time. </p>

<p><p>I also like photography, it is a hobby I have come to appreciate and love. I have included some photos that I have taken this year.</p>
