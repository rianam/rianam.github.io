            <h1>A little about myself..</h1>
            
            <p> My name is Riana Marisol Melendez. I am 19 years old and currently a transfer junior journalism major at the University of Florida. 

<p>Beginning with my trip to Italy at 17 and followed by a trip to Ireland at 18, inspired by four teenagers – myself along with three close friends – ready to prove that we were old enough to venture the world without adults, I feel in love with traveling. Now at 19 I am planning a trip with more friends to explore Iceland and Spain this summer. </p>

<p>Although both of my parents were born in Puerto Rico, I had the pleasure of being born in ice-cold Grand Rapids, Michigan. At age 11 my mother decided that she wanted a fresh new start somewhere new, and took her real estate business and moved it to Avon Park, FL, where I have lived ever since. </p>

<p>Although figuring out what I wanted to do with my future was a very tough decision for me, I decided to pursue journalism half way through getting my a ssociates in arts.</p>
            
<p>Why you ask? For one, I want to end up working for National Geographic one day (which has something to do with my passion for seeing the world). Secondly, I love the thrill of the moment – the here and now. I like being able to capture a moment not through a picture, but through words. Especially moments that we will always remember.  I also believe that words can have a strong hold on people and I want to use the right ones to help, change, inform and inspire.</p>

<p>I am absolutely in love with books. From a very young age I just loved opening a good book and getting drawn in and lost in the words for hours at a time. </p>
